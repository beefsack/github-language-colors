GitHub Language Colors
======================

A scraper written in Go to get the GitHub language colors as JSON.

Note that this is a silly idea, the full list of colors are available in the
[github/linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) [data files](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).
